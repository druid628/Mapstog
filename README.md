**Mapstog**  

![Project status](http://stillmaintained.com/druid628/Mapstog.png)  
Version: 1.1.0   
=-----------------=  
Mapstog is a program written over a couple days just to kill some time and demonstrate to people how spammers gather email addresses. Note this program will not dig through the entire site ONLY the page specified. 
Future releases will allow for printing and other fun stuff.  
Maybe, just MAYBE, I might add the link following capability to it (if I have time and feel like it).  

*Note from creator:*  
This program should be used for instructional purposes ONLY. Please DO NOT use this program for harm.  
  
  
Thanks,
